## ML Interpreter
The project extends the interpreter of the imperative and functional language including blocks, procedures and functions. \
\
It has been extended compared to the one seen in class with:
- String type;
- functions for Strings required by the specifics;
- functions used by Reflect command;
- more (not required) functions on Strings;
- Char type.

This project is written in OCaml using Denotational Semantic. \
\
**Considerations**
Not all the expressions are implemented into the Reflect. The String that the Reflect analyzes must be without spaces.
